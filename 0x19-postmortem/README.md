# Postmortem: The HAProxy Hiccup - When Load Balancers Take a Break

## The HAProxy Drama in Summary:

- Duration: August 16, 2024, 19:30 UTC (45 minutes)
- Impact: For 45 minutes, our website was completely inaccessible, leaving 100% of our visitors stranded in the void. Requests were being rejected faster than bad dad jokes, with zero service available during the downtime.
- Root Cause: Our HAProxy configuration had a case of "split personalities"—duplicate frontend and backend names. HAProxy is not fond of such identity conflicts and refused to start, leaving our users high and dry.

### The Timeline of Events:
- 18:45 UTC: 🚨 Monitoring alerts go haywire—HAProxy down, services offline.
- 18:46 UTC: 🧐 Initial investigation begins—logs reveal some odd config errors.
- 18:50 UTC: 🛠️ A team member suggests it could be a config typo—config file checked.
- 18:55 UTC: ⚙️ First restart attempt—HAProxy is still grumpy.
- 19:00 UTC: 🛑 Misleading clue—suspected network issues, we dive down the wrong rabbit hole.
- 19:10 UTC: 🆘 A friend with fresh eyes suggests checking for duplicate entries—lightbulb moment.
- 19:15 UTC: 🔍 Bingo! Duplicate frontend and backend names found in the config—time for cleanup.
- 19:20 UTC: 📝 Edits made, duplicates removed, configuration validated.
- 19:25 UTC: 🥳 HAProxy finally agrees to start.
- 19:30 UTC: 🌐 Services fully restored, users back online, crisis averted.

### Root Cause:

- The culprit was our HAProxy configuration file, which contained duplicate names in both the frontend and backend sections. HAProxy, like most software, expects unique identifiers for these sections. With the conflicting names, it refused to start, causing the traffic routing to halt entirely.

#### Resolution:
- We identified and removed the duplicate entries, giving each section a unique identifier. After confirming the updated configuration was correct, we restarted HAProxy, and everything was back in action.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Config Peer Reviews: All HAProxy config changes will now require a mandatory peer review—no more solo cowboy edits.
- Automated Validation: We’ll integrate automated syntax checks into our CI/CD pipeline to catch these issues before they hit production.
- Enhanced Monitoring: Our monitoring setup will be upgraded to include HAProxy-specific config validation and service status checks for faster issue detection.

#### Action Items:
- Peer Reviews: Implement a two-person review process for all HAProxy configuration changes.
- CI/CD Pipeline Upgrade: Add automated syntax validation for HAProxy configurations to prevent similar issues from sneaking through.
- Monitoring Enhancements: Integrate config validation checks into our monitoring tools, allowing for immediate alerts if HAProxy fails to start due to config issues.
- Team Training: Schedule a "How to Keep HAProxy Happy" workshop to educate the team on best practices and common pitfalls when configuring HAProxy.
