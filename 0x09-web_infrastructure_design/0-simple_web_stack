Questions and Answers

- What is a server :- A server is a computer that provides informatioin to other computers (clients) over a network

- What is the role of the domain name :- Domain names make it easier for users to access websites. Instead of typing in a long string of numbers (IP address), users can enter a simple, memorable name in their browser's address bar.

- What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com :- it is a CNAME(canonical name) record.

- What is the role of the web server :- The web servers primary role is to handle request from clients(typically web browsers) for web pages and other resources. When a user enters a URL into their browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server for the desired resource. Web servers support plug-ins for scripting languages (for example, ASP, JSP, PHP, Perl) that enable the web server to generate dynamic content based on server-side logic.

- What is the role of the application server :- The application server enables interaction between user client and server-side application code.

- What is the role of the database :- data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized using a database.

- What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website :- The server uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure variant, HTTPS, to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website.

explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:-

- SPOF :- The entire infrastructure relies on a single server, leading to potential downtime if the server fails.

- Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted) :- Deploying new code or restarting the web server for updates can cause downtime, impacting user access.

- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic :- The infrastructure may struggle to handle high traffic loads, limiting scalability and potentially causing performance issues during traffic`.
