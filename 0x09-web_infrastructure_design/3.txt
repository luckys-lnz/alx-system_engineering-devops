Explanation of Components
Additional Elements
Load Balancer 2 (HAProxy) Cluster:

Purpose: Adding a second load balancer configured in a cluster with the first one ensures high availability. If one load balancer fails, the other can take over, providing continuous service.
HAProxy Configuration: The two HAProxy load balancers are set up in an active-passive or active-active configuration, ensuring load distribution and failover capabilities.
Web Server:

Purpose: The web server handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from users, serving static content and forwarding requests to the application server as needed.
Dedicated Server: Splitting the web server onto its own machine isolates its resources, improving performance and security.
Application Server:

Purpose: The application server runs the application logic, processing user requests and interacting with the database server as needed.
Dedicated Server: Having a dedicated server for the application layer enhances performance, scalability, and security.
Database Server:

Purpose: The database server manages and stores the website's data. It processes read and write operations required by the application.
Dedicated Server: A separate database server ensures better performance, scalability, and security for data operations.
Additional Server:

Purpose: This additional server could be used to enhance redundancy, serve as a backup, or be part of a cluster (like for the database server).
Usage: In this design, it can be used for database replication or as an additional application server to handle more load.
Firewalls
Firewall 1: Placed between the internet and the load balancers to filter incoming traffic.
Firewall 2: Between the load balancers and the internal network, providing an additional layer of security.
Firewall 3: Protects the Web Server.
Firewall 4: Protects the Application Server.
Firewall 5: Protects the Database Server.
Purpose of Firewalls:

Firewalls provide a crucial layer of security by controlling traffic based on security rules, blocking malicious traffic, and allowing legitimate traffic.
Security and Monitoring Components
SSL Certificate
SSL Certificate: Installed at both load balancers to handle HTTPS traffic, ensuring encrypted communication between clients and the load balancers.
Purpose of HTTPS:

HTTPS encrypts data between the client and the server, protecting it from interception and tampering.
Monitoring Clients
Monitoring Clients: Installed on each server (Web Server, Application Server, Database Server) to collect performance data, logs, and alerts.
Purpose of Monitoring:
Monitoring helps in detecting issues, ensuring optimal performance, and aiding in capacity planning.
Tools like Sumologic gather logs, metrics, and other data, providing insights into server health and application performance.
Monitoring Specifics
Data Collection: The monitoring clients collect data like CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic. They also gather application-specific metrics and database performance metrics.
Monitoring QPS: To monitor Queries Per Second (QPS) on the database, the monitoring client should be configured to collect and report this metric, often available through database performance monitoring tools.
Potential Issues and Solutions
SSL Termination at the Load Balancer Level:

Issue: Traffic between the load balancers and internal servers is not encrypted.
Solution: Use SSL passthrough or re-encrypt traffic between the load balancers and internal servers to maintain encryption end-to-end.
Single MySQL Server for Writes:

Issue: A single MySQL server can become a bottleneck and single point of failure.
Solution: Implement database replication or clustering (e.g., MySQL Cluster, Galera Cluster) to distribute the load and provide redundancy.
Servers with All Same Components:

Issue: Combining web, application, and database components on the same server can lead to resource contention.
Solution: Separate servers for each component improve performance, security, and scalability.
