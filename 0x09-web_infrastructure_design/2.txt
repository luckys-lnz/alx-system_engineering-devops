Explanation of Components
Firewalls
Firewall 1: Placed between the internet and the load balancer to filter incoming traffic, ensuring only legitimate requests reach the load balancer.
Firewall 2: Protects Web Server 1 from potential threats originating from the load balancer or internal network.
Firewall 3: Protects Web Server 2 similarly.
Firewall 4: Protects Web Server 3 similarly.
Purpose of Firewalls:

Firewalls are security devices designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. They filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on an applied rule set to block malicious traffic and allow legitimate traffic.
Load Balancer (with SSL Termination)
SSL Certificate: Installed at the load balancer to handle HTTPS traffic, providing encryption and secure communication between clients and the server.
Purpose of HTTPS: Serving traffic over HTTPS ensures that data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering.
Web Servers
Web Server 1, 2, 3: These servers host the application, serving web pages to users. They are placed behind individual firewalls for additional security.
Monitoring Clients
Monitoring Clients: Installed on each web server and the database server to collect metrics, logs, and other relevant data.
Purpose of Monitoring:
Monitoring helps in maintaining the health and performance of the infrastructure.
It detects issues proactively and provides insights into server performance and application behavior.
It helps in capacity planning and identifying security threats.
MySQL Database Server
Database Server: Holds the data for www.foobar.com. It should ideally be a part of a replicated setup to ensure high availability and failover capabilities.
Monitoring Details
Data Collection: Monitoring tools like Sumologic collect data through installed agents or clients on each server. These agents gather logs, metrics (like CPU usage, memory usage), and application-specific data and send it to a central monitoring service for analysis and visualization.
Monitoring QPS (Queries Per Second): To monitor QPS, configure the monitoring client to track and report database queries per second. This can usually be done by enabling specific database metrics within the monitoring tool.
Potential Issues with This Infrastructure
SSL Termination at the Load Balancer Level:

Issue: Terminating SSL at the load balancer means that traffic between the load balancer and web servers is not encrypted. This can be a security risk if the internal network is compromised.
Solution: Use SSL passthrough or re-encrypt traffic between the load balancer and web servers.
Single MySQL Server for Writes:

Issue: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes can become a bottleneck and a single point of failure.
Solution: Implement MySQL replication with failover mechanisms, or use a clustered database solution like MySQL Cluster or Galera Cluster.
Servers with All Same Components:

Issue: Having servers with the same components (database, web server, and application server) can lead to resource contention and makes scaling difficult.
Solution: Separate concerns by dedicating specific servers to specific roles (e.g., separate database servers, application servers, and web servers) to optimize resource usage and scalability.
